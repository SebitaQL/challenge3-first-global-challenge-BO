# challenge3-first-global-challenge-BO
This is the third project of the challenges to be one of those chosen as a member of the robotics team.

Health is essential, that's why we have to take care of our bodies because of the coronavirus. The goal of this project is for people to become more aware of measuring their vital signs on a daily basis. This is necessary because the grave changes in these signs may mean something bad and always is better to be prepaid.
The project consists of a python programmed plotter, a sketch in Arduino, and a file .csv, named medical_history.csv where data is gonna be saved.
Schematics and code are available in the Fritzing file, therefor you can replicate the project by your own.

A BlueTooth module was added because I wanted to make an Android application with AppInventor2 but I was running out of time to do it.
